=====================

Bangor History Museum wants a website. They also have 40,000 unique historical artifacts.
Can we do anything cool with this? Probably ;-)

Goal
-----

Allow users to connect to a website, and view historical artifacts relevant to their current
location. Perhaps especially historical photos.

Proposal
--------
 
Archiving information is a done deal. We can store data very easily in all kinds of ways. 
But what about providing ways for people to FIND history? This should actually be a 
solvable problem. Location-based data, HTML5 location-aware browsers, and cell connections.

  1. Backend data store
  2. Admin interface to input data
  3. Lookup missing gis coordinates if we only have addresses
  4. Solr-backend for proximity queries
  5. Very basic front end to display artifacts relevant to the current location
